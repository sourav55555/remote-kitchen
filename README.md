-- If I worked on a Hotfix in frontend development and the hotfix is for some responsive issue then "responsive-issue-quickfix" will be my branch name. After finishing the code, I will push my code on "responsive-issue-quickfix" branch. There will be a create pull request option on github link. I will create a pull request by selecting the production branch with my "responsive-issue-quickfix" branch. 
After that, I will review the marge conflict (if there is any) and merge the pull request. This will merge the production branch with responsive-issue-quickfix.


# 2nd question ans
--In the data menuItems with type is set. So I will check the category's menuItems first. When I get the category manuItems id's, I will check all available menuItem lists of all "types" and find the matching menuItem id's with the category. Then I can somehow store or display the category's menuItem full data. I will do the same process for each category and hopefully, this will help the data showing and working process.
I will use some filters, find, nested loops, etc for getting the values in the code.
