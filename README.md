# 1st question ans
-- If I worked on a Hotfix in frontend development and the hotfix is for some responsive issue then "responsive-issue-quickfix" will be my branch name. After finishing the code, I will push my code on "responsive-issue-quickfix" branch. There will be a create pull request option on github link. I will create a pull request by selecting the production branch with my "responsive-issue-quickfix" branch. 
After that, I will review the marge conflict (if there is any) and merge the pull request. This will merge the production branch with responsive-issue-quickfix.


# 2nd question ans
--I am not sure about how much my approach will work. As I understood and thought, first I will check all types of collections menu items, then I will check each category menu item id's and will check the corresponding id's which match with the menu items id's. Filter the matching id's menu item and store those values, so that I can show the manuitems name for categories also. 
I will use some filters, find, nested loops, etc for getting the values in the code.
